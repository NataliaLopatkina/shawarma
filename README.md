## Building a project with Gulp
All tasks for which the project is being built are in the file `gulpfile.js`.

### Gulp tasks
#### `$ gulp go`
1. Starts the server.
2. Monitors the changes of all files located in folders `_blocks` and `_pages`.
3. Collects CSS files from folders `_pages/name of page` and puts in a folder `stylesheets`.
4. Minimizes the resulting CSS files and puts it next to the originals.
5. Collects HTML files from folders `_pages/name of page` and puts in the root of the project.
6. Aligns indents in received HTML files.

#### `$ gulp go -page index`
It helps speed up the build due to the fact that only one page is collected.
1. Starts the server.
2. Monitors the changes of all files located in folders `_blocks` and **only** for `_pages/index.pug` and `_pages/index.сss`, all other files from the folder `_pages` are ignored.
3. Collects CSS files from folders `_pages/index/index.css` and puts in a folder `stylesheets`.
4. Minimizes the resulting CSS files and puts it next to the originals.
5. Collects HTML files from folders `_pages/index/index.pug` and puts in the root of the project.
6. Aligns indents in received HTML files.

*`index` specified for example, instead of it can be any page title*

#### `$ gulp go -page index -style common`
It helps speed up the build due to the fact that only one page is collected.
`-style common` should be used if the project has a common CSS file for all pages.
1. Starts the server.
2. Monitors the changes of all files located in folders `_blocks` and **only** for `_pages/index.pug` and `_pages/common/common.сss`, all other files from the folder `_pages` are ignored .
3. Collects CSS files from folders `_pages/common/common.css` and puts in a folder `stylesheets`.

1. Collects CSS files from folders `_pages/имя-страницы` and puts in a folder `stylesheets`.
2. Minimizes the resulting CSS files and puts it next to the originals.
3. Collects HTML files from folders `_pages/имя-страницы` and puts in the root of the project.
